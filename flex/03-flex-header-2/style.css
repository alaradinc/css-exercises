/* 

why did i have to put a '.' in front of 
left and right? why was it not required for 
other classes?

why did making this a flex display cause the 
'left' and 'right' objects to bump up a line?

Answer: Because, we grouped Logo and the links together
and we grouped notification button and profilie photo together
as a result we gave them a 'felxible box' to display in, so they bumped up a line

why were they beneath each other in the first place?
and not on the same line? since there was no <br>?
